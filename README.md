# Mo Spec
Motoko specs that are easy to read and learn, allowing you to ship Motoko code with confidence.

## Credits
- Underneath the hood, it's using [Motoko Matchers](https://kritzcreek.github.io/motoko-matchers) of [Christoph Hegemann](https://github.com/kritzcreek)
- Empowered by [ActorSpec](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base/tree/e4efcb9bbd8c8eeff41b3d461b679e43d1d66f44/examples/actorspec) of [Joachim Breitner](https://github.com/nomeata)
- Based on the example [Motoko Unit Tests](https://github.com/krpeacock/motoko-unit-tests) of [Kyle Peacock](https://github.com/krpeacock)
- Based on the use of Mo-Dev on the packages testing of [Motoko Base](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko-base/)
- Heavily inspired by other Spec frameworks, mostly RSpec, but also Jest.
